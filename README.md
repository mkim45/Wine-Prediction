# Wine-Prediction
A Python project for final coursework in a Northwestern University STAT_303-3 Data Science in Python course. The project was completed in 2023 as part of a four-person team.

The project involved conducting an examination of data from Vinho Verde wines from this link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/186/wine+quality. Red and white wine data was combined and allowed for utilizing MARS, decision trees, bagging, boosting (XGBoost), and random forest models that were tuned for ideal hyperparameters and ensembled using voting and stacking regressors to deliver conclusions. 

Python libraries, including Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Numpy, Sklearn, xgb, and others, were utilized to identify relevant predictor variables and to build, tune, and use the necessary models.
